abstract = "We present DejaVu, a 3D virtual world co-simulator for 'visual diffing' of cyber-physical system deployments in indoor and outdoor environments. Using faster-than-real-time simulation and efficient recording DejaVu can record days of simulation data, including environmental, sensor and network data for later replay and analysis. DejaVu enables developers to replay and visually compare multiple simulations simultaneously using different visual diffing techniques, including ghosts, paths, colour and size, highlighting differences between runs, including energy consumption, radio metrics, movement, etc. We demonstrate several of these visual diffing techniques in an CPS-enhanced evacuation case study."
