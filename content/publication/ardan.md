abstract = "In this paper we present Ardán, a novel simulation platform using a 3D game engine to stand-in for the real world, providing realistic physics and realistic crowds that can interact in real-time with a cyber-physical simulation. Ardán features 3D device (sensor and actuator) placement, flexible time-control, phenomena-on-demand as well visualisation, virtual devices and native application code. The flexibility, control and scalability of Ardán is demonstrated with a corridor case-study that supports upto 200 nodes running at real-time or faster."
