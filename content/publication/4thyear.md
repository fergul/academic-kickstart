abstract = "With the advent of cheap, low-power and small devices, it becomes possible to embed these devices within our everyday surroundings, to create an always connected, sensing and reacting “Internet of Things”, with the purpose of not only simplifying our lives but also saving energy at the same time. But in order to achieve devices of such size, the resources available is restricted. Because of this, current protocols for connecting traditional devices together simply don't cater for the constraints of such devices, therefore a new protocol which understands the constraints of these devices and is designed around this “Internet of Things” revolution is necessary."
