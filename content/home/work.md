I've had the opportunity to intern at two great companies, Fujitsu Labs and JP Morgan, during my academic career.

I've worked at the Fujitsu Human Centric Robotics Lab in Atsugi, Japan and got to experience life there for three months. Whilst there I enjoyed the wonderful weather (lovely sun, oh and a typhoon, earthquake and many sweaty commutes) and worked with a fantastic team on an very cool teddy bear robotics project, [check him out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwWeN1ARy74). I also wrote a [little blog about my trip here](http://fergusleahy.wordpress.com/).
