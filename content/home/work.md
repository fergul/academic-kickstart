I'm currently working at Tab, a travel payments startup, as a Senior Software Engineer, based in London. We're working as an awesome tight-knit team developing our existing payments platform (migrated to PY3, adding support for SCA/3DS2/ApplePay/AndroidPay, extending it with new and exciting features for our wonderful merchants), building a react-native mobile payments app and architecting an entirely new travel content platform where independent businesses and travellers can explore, plan and share the best travel tips, guides and itineraries.

Previously, I've worked at the Fujitsu Human Centric Robotics Lab in Atsugi, Japan and got to experience life there for three months. Whilst there I enjoyed the wonderful weather (lovely sun, oh and a typhoon, earthquake and many sweaty commutes) and worked with a fantastic team on an very cool teddy bear robotics project, [check him out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwWeN1ARy74). I also wrote a [little blog about my trip here](http://fergusleahy.wordpress.com/).
