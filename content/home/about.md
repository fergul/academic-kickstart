# Biography
I'm a PhD student in Distributed Software Engineering within the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. 

Now completing a PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision by Dr. Naranker Dulay, focusing on building visual simulation tools and techniques, coined "Visual Diffing", for developing and testing Cyber-Physical systems and the Internet of Things.

My research interests include cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, smart devices, embedded + constrained devices, robotics, human-centric computing, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, distributed systems and operating systems.

I've previously interned at [Fujitsu Labs Japan](https://fergusleahy.wordpress.com/) and JP Morgan, getting a taste of research and corporate organisations.

When I'm not coding or doing research I enjoy paddling and captaining for my local dragon boat team [Typhoon](http://typhoon-dbc.com), [designing card games](/#projects), playing card, board + video games, learning languages (Japanese + Cantonese), kite flying, tinkering with electronics and in the winter months (or at the Snow Centre) skiing and [snowboarding](https://youtu.be/eoIVr3U0t_4).
